						<h1 class="colortext">Hey, Ilana Isegall!</h2>
						<br/>
						<p>
							Let me introduce myself. I'm Jullie Utsch, a 22-year-old Comunication student based on Belo Horizonte, Brazil; <mark>passionate</mark> about art, web, coding and telling great stories on all sort of media basis. I've got a <mark>hybrid</mark> professional profile, with skills and experiences on art, comunication, audiovisuals and coding. Also, I love cats. : )
						</p>
						<p>
							I've learned a couple days ago about Outreachy internship program and got caught by your project. I would love to learn some more about data visualization and d3 in such a great community, and got pretty excited about the possibility of coming together and joining in. I am not a super expert on d3, but I'm a fast learner, curious and got some solid experience on web-dev.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've been involved in discuss and promote women in tech, and it is really important for me. I'm a proud coder girl and I know it matters. 
						</p>
						<p>	
							So I thought you would like to know a little bit more about me. Take a look!

				              	At the second half of 2011 I started another internship at the communication assessory of the Health Campus at UFMG. I was responsible for editing and maintaining web pages. I stayed for two years and quit at 2012 to enter a research on gender studies.
